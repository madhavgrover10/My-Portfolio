## 🚗 1. Car Price Prediction

📁 Folder: Car-Price-Prediction

Goal:
Build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as engine specifications, fuel type, and brand.

Key Steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
-Feature engineering (brand extraction and correction)
-One-hot and target encoding for categorical data
-Model comparison: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
-Evaluation using R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE
-Predicted vs Actual Prices Visualization
-Feature importance visualization

Highlights:

-Achieved R² = 0.957 using Random Forest

-visualized Predicted vs Actual Prices

-Visualized top 10 most influential features

-Compared baseline and regularized regression models


🧾 Skills used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
