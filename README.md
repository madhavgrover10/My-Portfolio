# My-Portfolio
A curated collection of my Data Science and Machine Learning projects — showcasing skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.

## 🚗 1. Car Price Prediction

📁 Folder: Car-Price-Prediction

Goal:
Build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as engine specifications, fuel type, and brand.

Key Steps:

-Data cleaning and preprocessing

-Feature engineering (brand extraction and correction)

-One-hot and target encoding for categorical data

-Model comparison: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting

-Evaluation using R², MAE, MSE, RMSE and Cross-Validation

-Predicted vs Actual Prices Visualization

-Feature importance visualization

Highlights:

-Achieved R² = 0.956 using Random Forest

-5-Fold Cross-Validation confirmed robust model performance (CV R² mean ≈ 0.887, Std ≈ 0.069) 

-visualized Predicted vs Actual Prices

-Visualized top 10 most influential features

-Compared baseline and regularized regression models


🧾 Skills used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 2. 📞Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

📁 Folder:Customer Churn Prediction

Goal:
Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company and identify the key factors influencing customer retention.

🎯 Objectives

-Analyze customer behavior and service usage patterns

-Handle class imbalance and optimize recall for churn detection

-Compare multiple machine learning models

-Identify key factors driving churn

🧩 Dataset

-Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)

Key Features:

-tenure, MonthlyCharges, Contract, PaymentMethod, InternetService

-Derived features like avg_charge_per_tenure, tenure_monthlycharges, is_long_term

Key Steps:

-Data loading, exploration, and visualization of churn distribution

-Handling missing values and data type conversions

-Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding

-Feature engineering: created tenure-based and interaction features

-Balancing data using SMOTE to address class imbalance

-Data scaling using StandardScaler

-Model comparison: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

-Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for Gradient Boosting

-Model evaluation using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix

-ROC Curve and Permutation Importance visualization

Highlights:

-Achieved Test Accuracy = 0.79 and ROC-AUC = 0.844 using tuned Gradient Boosting

-Identified key drivers of churn such as Contract Type, Fiber Optic Internet, Tenure, and Monthly Charges

-Used SMOTE to effectively balance churn vs. non-churn classes

-Visualized Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Top 10 Important Features

🧾 Skills used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Imbalanced-learn
